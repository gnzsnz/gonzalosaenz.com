Summary: This post is an introduction TOGAF and it's core concepts. It summarizes the content and structure of TOGAF 9 standard.

# TOGAF Core Concepts

TOGAF is structured to reflect - in terms of structure and content - an Enterprise Architecture capability within an organization.

TOGAF Part I is an [introduction][] and definitely should read it!

# Part II - Architecture Development Method

The TOGAF Architecture Development Method or ADM is the result of continuous contributions from a large number of architecture practitioners. It describes a method for developing and managing the lifecycle of an Enterprise Architecture, and forms the core of the TOGAF standard.

The application of the TOGAF ADM is supported by an extended set of resources, guidelines, templates, checklists, and other detailed materials:

-   Part III: ADM Guidelines & Techniques
-   White Papers and Guides published by The Open Group, classified and referenced in the TOGAF Library

Some Key points to understand ADM:

-   The ADM is iterative.

      For each Iteration architects decide, breadth, level of detail, architectural assets to be leveraged.

-   ADM is generic.

      As a generic method it may be tailored to specific needs, like the organization, the iteration, level of maturity, etc.
