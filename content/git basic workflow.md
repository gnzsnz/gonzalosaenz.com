Summary: This post describes a basic git workflow. This is what I follow to keep track of changes in this blog.

This post describes a basic git workflow. This is what I follow to keep track of changes in this blog.

I will cover, how to create a [bare repository](#bare), a [local repository](#local), and the [workflow](#workflow) to make changes.

# Bare Repository <a name="bare"></a>

The bare repository is a non working repository. It impossible to edit files and commit changes in that repository. the whole idea of a bare repository is to pull and push into it, but never directly commit into it. A bare repository is just used for storage, as oposed to a development repository.

![git_repository][]

```shell
git init --bare gonzalosaenz.com.git
```

# Local repository <a name="local"></a>

A local repository can be created with

```shell
git init gonzalosaenz.com
```

This will create an empty local repository. You can create and edit files in the local repository with your favorite text editor. once you create files, they can be add those files to your git repository within

```shell
git add .
```

Once you finish working on your files. you can perform a:

```shell
git status
```
This will list any pending changes. then you might:

```shell
git add . # too add and pending changes
git commit -m "commit message."
```

This will commit your changes to your local repository. however we haven't linked yet the local and remote (bare) repositories. in order to do so,

```shell
git remote add gonzalosaenz.com me@gitserver.com:~/gonzalosaenz.com.git
git push --set-upstream gonzalosaenz.com master
```
In case it needs to be clarified, "me@gitserver.com:~/gonzalosaenz.com.git" is a fake repository. You can use [github][], [gitlab][], [bitbucket][], hosted it in your server, etc.

Next step is to push your local copy of the repository to the remote repository. This will make your local changes available in the remote repository.

```shell
git push gonzalosaenz.com
```

In the local repository you can query your remore repository with:

```shell
git remote -v
origin  gonzo@gnzsnz.com:~/Documents/server/dev/gonzalosaenz.com.git (fetch)
origin  gonzo@gnzsnz.com:~/Documents/server/dev/gonzalosaenz.com.git (push)
```

# Workflow <a name="workflow"></a>

And finally the git workflow. So every time I write a new post, I would:

1) clone a local copy of the repository:

```shell
git clone me@gitserver.com:~/gonzalosaenz.com.git
cd gonzalosaenz.com
```

2) create my working environment

```shell
virtualenv .
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
make devserver
```

3) work on your post. don't forget to save your changes!

4) commit your changes

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "new post about git"
```

5) and push your changes to the central repository

```shell
git push gonzalosaenz.com
```

# Final thoughts

There are a few things that I didn't cover in this enty. Like how to create a [pelican][] blog. I might or might not cover this in a future post.
